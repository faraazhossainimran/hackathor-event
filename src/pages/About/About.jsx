It was a small gathering of like-minded individuals who wanted to explore their creativity and problem-solving skills. The success of that event inspired us to continue organizing hackathons and expand our reach to a wider audience. <br></br> Over the years, we have grown exponentially, hosting numerous hackathons across various industries and themes. We have had the privilege of collaborating with leading companies, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations, creating a dynamic ecosystem where innovation thrives.</p>
